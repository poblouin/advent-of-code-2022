# Advent of Code 2022

[Advent 2022](https://adventofcode.com/)

My second year attempting the challenge. Last year I stopped at day 10, let's see how far I can get this time :D

## Start a new day

To start new day, run the following command:

```sh
./generate_day [day_number]
```

By default, the generated folder will be the current day. e.g. if you run this command on Dec 4th, the folder generated will be `04`
If you want to generate a day other than the current date, just provide the `day_number`. e.g. `./generate_day 04`.
